# My Personal Dotfiles

> My MacOS dotfiles, using [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

## Installation

---

**Important:** Be careful before setting this up - your existing dotfiles may be nuked!

---

```
gem install homesick
homesick clone benconstable/dotfiles
homesick symlink dotfiles
```

## What's in here?

My dotfiles leverage this excellent open source software:

* [technicalpickles/homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) for installation and version control
* [robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) as a management framework
* [sindresorhus/pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) to make everything look pretty
